# 02620_ml_group5
Collection of code files used for 02-620 Machine Learning for Scientists project by Anagha Anil, Leila Michal, Brian Zhang, and Jonathan Zhu.

## Instructions for use
All relevant code is in Jupyter Notebooks whose cells can simply be executed in order, after which results are visible. In this project, the relevant code includes logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. 

Recursive feature elimination and logistic regression functions are contained in the file 'FeatureEliminationLogisticRegression.ipynb'.

Decision trees and random forests have their underying functions coded in 'decisiontrees.py' and 'randomforest.py', while the actual prediction process is found in 'predict_trees_forest.ipynb'. Additionally, the selected parameters used to build the models can be found in the folder 'dtrf_params' should you want to remake the models.

Gradient boosting is found in 'GradientBoosting.ipynb' and 'GradientBoostSklearnFeatureElimination.ipynb'.
